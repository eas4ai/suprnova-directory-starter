# Cookie-name prefix for the session and remember-me cookies.
# "__Host-" is the production hardening: the browser refuses the cookie
# unless it is Secure, Path=/, and Domain-less, so a compromised sibling
# subdomain cannot shadow it. It requires HTTPS (SESSION_SECURE=true)
# and is incompatible with SESSION_DOMAIN. Leave empty for local HTTP
# development - with SESSION_SECURE=false a prefixed cookie would be
# silently dropped by the browser.
